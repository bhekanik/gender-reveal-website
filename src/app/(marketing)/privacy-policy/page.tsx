        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>
          Our services may contain links to other websites, applications, and

          on another third party link, you will be directed to that third
          party&apos;s website, application, or online service. The fact that we
          link to a website or content is not an endorsement, authorization, or
          representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an
          endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or
          practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites or
          services.
        </p>
        <h2>Third Party Privacy Policies</h2>
        <p>
          Our Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites. Thus, we advise
          you to consult the respective Privacy Policies of these third-party ad
          servers for more detailed information. This may include their
          practices and instructions about how to opt-out of certain options.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can choose to disable cookies through your individual browser
          options. To know more detailed information about cookie management
          with specific web browsers, it can be found at the browsers&apos;
          respective websites.
        </p>
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device by your
          browser. They serve various purposes, such as remembering your
          preferences, enhancing user experience, and facilitating
          authentication.
        </p>
        <p>
          At our site, we utilize third-party authentication services, including
          Google OAuth and Github OAuth, to secure and streamline the login
          process. When you log in using OAuth, a cookie is generated and stored
          on your device. This cookie is essential for the proper functioning of
          our authentication system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The OAuth cookie contains a unique identifier that helps us recognize
          your authenticated session. It enables you to access our application
          seamlessly without the need to re-enter your credentials repeatedly
          during a single session.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s important to note that these cookies do not store personal
          information directly on our servers. Instead, they serve as tokens
          that establish a secure connection between your browser and the
          authentication provider. This enhances the security of the
          authentication process while providing a more user-friendly
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using our site and opting for third-party authentication, you
          consent to the use of cookies for authentication purposes. You can
          manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings.
